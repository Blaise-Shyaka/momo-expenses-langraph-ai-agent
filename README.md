# momo-expenses-langraph-ai-agent

This is an AI-assistant that lets you initiate payments and log expenses using natural language or voice.
It's integrated with [MoMo API](https://momodeveloper.mtn.com/) and could support other modes of payments in the future.
It would understand commands like "Pay 30k for my internet bill" or "How much did I spend on fuel in the past month?".

Chat interactions are triggered from an MCP client built with copilot-kit, communicating with an MCP server that orchestrates tool calls via Gemini-powered LangGraph.

## Current Architecture

The project currently consists of:
- **Expenses Agent**: LangGraph-powered agent for expense tracking using Gemini
- **Expenses API**: FastAPI backend with SQLite database for expense management
- **UI**: Next.js frontend with Assistant UI for chat interactions
- **Database**: SQLite for storing expenses and categories

## Running the Project Locally

The project consists of several components that need to be started individually. The project can only be run locally at the moment.

Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Blaise-Shyaka/momo-expenses-langraph-ai-agent.git
```

---

### 1. API

Handles business logic and writes expenses to a SQLite database.

**Steps:**

```bash
cd expenses-api         # Navigate to the API directory
pip install -r requirements.txt   # Install dependencies
uvicorn main:app       # Start the API server
```

---

### 2. LangGraph Agent

Langgraph tool-calling agent.

**Steps:**

```bash
cd expenses-agent         # Navigate to the agent directory
pip install -r requirements.txt   # Install dependencies
cp .env.example .env      # Copy environment example and update values
langgraph dev             # Start the LangGraph agent
```

> üí° Ensure all required API keys and environment variables are correctly set in `.env`.

---

### 3. UI

The frontend interface you‚Äôll use to interact with the agent. Runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Steps:**

```bash
cd ui/momo-expenses-agent   # Navigate to the UI directory
npm install                 # Install frontend dependencies
touch .env                  # Create an environment file
```

Add the following environment variables to `.env` (replace `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` with your actual key):

```
LANGGRAPH_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:2024
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=ls...13
NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGGRAPH_ASSISTANT_ID=chat
```

Then start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### ‚úÖ You‚Äôre Ready!

With all services running, you can now interact with the agent through the local UI.
